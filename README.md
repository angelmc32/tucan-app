## tucan app - part of the kukulc치n initiative

### what is kukulc치n?

a cultural movement that provides digital and physical spaces for artists, creators, builders, hackers, and dreamers. inspired by the mayan god kukulc치n, our vision is one of shared knowledge and social coordination for a better society. thru the use of technology, we will defy the status quo, the centralization and the barriers that we as humans have built thru history. we are the revolution.

### how does the tucan app fit in kukulc치n's vision

the tucan web application plays a critical role in finding the next builders in the region, nurture them and help them become succesful builders who can act as leaders for the ecosystem

## let's hack!

#### requirements

- nodejs v20.10.0 (lts) or latest
- git
- supabase or planetscale (for postgresql db) [supabase guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres).

### installation:

### env variables

create a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`

modify the following env variables

`DATABASE_URL`

### start the app

```bash
  bun run dev
```

app will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### db migration

run the migration script

```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev
```

you can use prisma studio to explore the db

```

prisma studio runs at `http://localhost:5050`.

for db changes/updates, follow this flow

1. modify the db schema, location `/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. create migration
3. keep working on the code
4. rinse and repeat in case of another change to the db

you can try out [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/migrate/developing-with-prisma-migrate) to learn more about the development flow when working with prisma
