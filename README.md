## tucan app - part of the kukulcán initiative

### what is kukulcán?

a cultural movement that provides digital and physical spaces for artists, creators, builders, hackers, and dreamers. inspired by the mayan god kukulcán, our vision is one of shared knowledge and social coordination for a better society. thru the use of technology, we will defy the status quo, the centralization and the barriers that we as humans have built thru history. we are the revolution.

### how does the tucan app fit in kukulcán's vision

the tucan web application plays a critical role in finding the next builders in the region, nurture them and help them become succesful builders who can act as leaders for the ecosystem

## let's hack!

#### requirements

### env variables

create a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`

modify the following env variables

`DATABASE_URL`

### start the app

```

app will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### db migration

run the migration script

```bash

you can use prisma studio to explore the db

prisma studio runs at `http://localhost:5050`.

for db changes/updates, follow this flow

1. modify the db schema, location `/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. create migration
3. keep working on the code
4. rinse and repeat in case of another change to the db

you can try out [this guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/migrate/developing-with-prisma-migrate) to learn more about the development flow when working with prisma
